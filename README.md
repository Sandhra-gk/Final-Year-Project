Crypto ransomware, a form of malicious software, continues to threaten digital ecosystems by encrypting files and coercing victims into paying ransoms
for decryption keys. These harmful programs are distributed through a variety of infection vectors. Ransomware, once infected, employs complex encryption
methods to keep files hostage and render them unavailable without the corresponding decryption key. In the absence of ransom payment, even
permanent data loss can occur. Our project achieves detection and prevention of ransomware attacks by incorporating a 3 layered sequential approach
consisting hash-based blacklisting (Layer 1), machine learning models trained on parameters extracted by cuckoo sandbox (Layer 2) and active detection
procedures using Honeyfiles along with entropy analysis (Layer 3).
